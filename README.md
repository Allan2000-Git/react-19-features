# React 19 Features
- useActionState hook: We need create states for loading/pending. This hooks avoids that and simplifies it for us
- useFormStatus: Avoids usage of context api. Gives us pending state of a form without having to pass it as a prop to its child elements because this hook checks nearest parent form.
